                  The biggest challenge we face as veterinary students is the
                  weight of academics,the long lectures and practical
                  sessions,the early mornings and the late nights, the lack of
                  support, and the fear of failure. This burden builds up, and
                  its consequences go far beyond bad grades. I envision a
                  faculty where academic stress turns into academic strength.

            <h3>ACTION PLAN</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Advocate for a free week before exams and lecture-free weekends,
                with reduced clinic rounds, so students can rest, refuel, and
                regain strength for the week ahead.
              </li>
              <li>
                Relaxation and stress relief programs: Organize faculty-wide
                relaxation and stress-relief programs such as hangouts,
                stress-relief talks, and other activities to help us breathe,
                recharge, and find balance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Launch student-led clubs and professional development such as
                the Equestrian Club (already in progress) in partnership
                with,and under the leadership of professionals, Small Animal
                Club, and Wildlife & Conservation Club. These will give students
                opportunities to explore our interests, gain practical exposure,
                and build professional networks before graduation.
              </li>

                  The welfare of students is not just a side concern; it's the
                  heartbeat of our association. Believe me when I say: if
                  students are not cared for, nothing else matters. Academic
                  excellence and personal development depend on wellbeing. Many
                  of us face challenges, ranging from academic pressure,
                  financial struggles, lack of support, or even mental burnout.
                  Some conditions can break a student if nothing is done. I
                  believe welfare must go beyond words to action.

            <h3>ACTION PLAN</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Emergency Welfare Support System: Seeking for support is normal,
                asking for help is powerful. I plan to introduce a welfare
                support scheme where students in need can access relief packs
                and basic support especially during exam period when the
                pressure is highest. Through partnership with alumni, sponsors
                and well-meaning stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Health and Mental Wellbeing Programs: This will ensure that
                every student is fit physically and mentally through free
                medical checkups in collaboration with Human medics, public
                health to provide personnel and equipment sponsors (labs,
                pharmacies, supplement companies) to provide essential supplies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Community Outreach Programs: organize faculty-driven community
                outreach such as dog vaccination drives, dog shows, wildlife
                awareness campaigns, and other public-health services. These
                projects will not only rove our relevance to the community but
                also attract sponsorships, boosting our welfare program which
                will be reinvested into the welfare of our students.
              </li>

                  Veterinary medicine is not just about surviving school; it's
                  about preparing for the future. We don't have to wait until
                  graduation before we discover our passion, build network or
                  create financial opportunities, I believe we can change that
                  starting now. My plan for innovation goes beyond the classroom
                  into the fields where our students can connect directly with
                  big top players in the vet space, clinicians and industry
                  leaders. Through this we will have access to mentorship and
                  internship placement to help guide us into the future.

            <h3>ACTION PLAN</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In a bold move to empower our people, during the Jos Breeders
                conference myself and some other stakeholders engaged the CEO of
                FarmAlert, Dr Femi Kayode in a strategic conversation to secure
                a landmark of interest and partnership to support visionary
                students with scalable investment worthy ideas to gain hands on
                guidance and connections to become changemakers in the vet
                space.
              </li>
              <li>
                Student enterprise: <br />
                As part of my vision to building a sustainable innovative
                enterprise, I would launch a small-scale students-led business
                venture (PIGGERY) to serve as a financial backbone for AVMS
                ensuring that we are less dependent on uncertain funding even
                long after our time here is over. This would Generate income to
                reinvest directly into student welfare program. After each
                litter, interested students will be allowed to adopt piglets at
                subsidized rates or flexible terms. This will provide a chance
                to start a small-scale farm project of their own, even while
                still in school. In return, students who adopts a piglet will
                remit a percentage of their profit to the association. This
                ensures sustainability and continued support for student welfare
                initiatives, giving interested students the chance to dream,
                plan and build wealth with hands on guidance from professionals.

                  A faculty thrives not only on books and tests but on the bonds
                  we build beyond the classroom, and for way too long we have
                  limited ourselves to the walls of our lecture halls and
                  clinics. My Vision is to create a more socially driven AVMS
                  where students don't just survive the rigor of Vet school but
                  truly connect, grow and belong. Academic advancement goes hand
                  in hand with social development. Through socially driven
                  events that would celebrate our diversity, cultural difference
                  and creativity we'll transform AVMS into a place where
                  memories are made and talents discovered.

            <h3>ACTION PLAN</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The books will teach us, but the field will transform us.
                Organise hangout sessions for every member of AVMS. Picture an
                association that believes in everyone’s cultural and religious
                differences. I would love to see an association that celebrates
                cultural differences from students and staff.
              </li>
              <li>
                I plan to introduce structured inter level activities that goes
                beyond academics, from sport tournaments, talent showcase,
                cultural mixers and professional quizzes. These events will
                boost student morale and give them a chance to learn, compete,
                play a role to break the barriers between students and create
                opportunity for true friendship, leadership and team spirit.
              </li>
              <li>
                Promoting equality through inclusive leadership: Leadership
                should never be distant from the people. To achieve this and
                make every student feel represented, I'll introduce the
                appointment of “Presidential Aids” from across different levels
                to serve as direct link between the executive body and students,
                bringing forward the challenges and concerns of each level and
                assisting in implementing student-centred projects and
                monitoring welfare issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                We deserve an upgrade of our vet week: I will set a new standard
                for the routine vet week and showcase the pride of our faculty.

                  For way too long our hard work as students has only been
                  measured by exams and postings, but our growth deserves more
                  than grades. We deserve recognition, celebration and
                  inspiration. That is why I plan to introduce the surgeon's

              <li>
                Recognition of effort; students will be awarded not just for academic excellence but for skills, leadership, innovation, creativity and dedication making hard work visible and rewarded.
