              We deserve a better academic experience. <br />
              No student should suffer in silence. <br />
              We deserve to be seen not just as students but as humans with
              dreams, talents,struggles, and potential. <br />
              We do not just want to survive Veterinary Medicine, We want to
              live through it, thrive in it, and leave it better than we met it.

              I believe we can rebrand AVMS and make history. Our Alumnis are
              recognised among the top in the country. We do not have to wait
              till we graduate to be recognised, we can shine as undergraduates
              of Veterinary Medicine. Veterinary Students are more than just
              brains, we have all it takes to make things happen

              minds, united individuals and a network that thrives beyond
              graduation.

              I believe no student should lose themselves in the pursuit of
              their dream.
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              I believe true Leadership is about active representation, standing
              for students, walking with them, and carrying their needs until
              they are met
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              I believe in Unity over division, n building a system where we
              support each other academically, socially, spiritually, and
              professionally.
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              I believe our struggles can shape us but only when we walk through
              them together.
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
              I believe a student body, when empowered, can change it's own
              story and I am here to lead that change.
